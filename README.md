## 📝 Note

This repository is a collection of code I've learned and created, serving as a backup in case I lose data locally. Apologies if it's a bit messy at the moment, but I'll gradually tidy it up.

Feel free to explore my projects, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or ideas for collaboration!
